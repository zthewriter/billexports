<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill requires the Motor
Vehicle Commission (MVC) to issue a placard to authorize parking privileges for
home care service employees who render care at a patient's home.&nbsp; The placards
would entitle the home care service employees to park their motor vehicles in
on-street areas that are generally reserved for municipal residents and in
municipal parking lots and college and university parking lots.&nbsp; The home care
service employees also would be entitled to park in these areas overnight.&nbsp; In
addition, the permit would entitle the home care service employees to travel on
roads which are designated by a municipality as being reserved for municipal
residents during certain times when traffic volume is high and to park overtime
at metered parking when rendering health or personal care services.&nbsp; The bill
specifically applies to the following employees licensed or certified under
Title 45 of the Revised Statutes: nurses, nurse aides, homemaker-home health
aides, or personal care assistants, and hospice care workers licensed under
Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the bill, the MVC would
issue the placards to home care service agencies which would then distribute
the placards to their employees who qualify as home care service employees.&nbsp; A
home care service agency applying for the placards would be required to submit
a copy of agency's license or other credentials issued by the Department of
Health or Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public
Safety.&nbsp; The bill requires the MVC to take action within 30 days of receiving a
home care service agency's application.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placard would be valid for
one year, but would be renewable for as long as the home care service agency
continues to render health or personal care services to patients in their
private residences.&nbsp; The bill allows the MVC to establish a one-time
registration fee of $50 or less for each parking placard issued.&nbsp; A home care
service agency would not be required to pay a fee when renewing the placards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

placard would be required to submit to the home care service agency a copy of
the employee's driver's license.&nbsp; The home care service agency would be
required to use the identifying numbers on the placards and employee driver's
license numbers to maintain a record of placards assigned to the agency's
employees. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill also requires home
care service employees to return the placard to the home care service agency
upon termination of employment. A home care service employee who fails to
return the placard within 30 days of termination of employment would be fined $100
by the MVC.&nbsp; The bill establishes an additional $100 fine to be imposed on a home
care service employee who improperly uses the placard.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Whenever a person has been
arrested for violating the provisions of this section and is suspected to have
operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of a narcotic,
hallucinogenic, or habit-producing drug, a police officer shall obtain a sample
of blood from the person for the purpose of conducting a chemical test to
determine the presence of any narcotic, hallucinogenic, or habit-producing drug
in the person's blood.&nbsp; A police officer shall not obtain a blood sample
without the consent of the arrested person or a valid search warrant.&nbsp; A blood
sample shall be obtained in a medically acceptable manner.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever an operator of a
motor vehicle has been involved in an accident resulting in death, bodily
injury or property damage, a police officer shall consider that fact along with
all other facts and circumstances in determining whether there are reasonable
grounds to believe that person was operating a motor vehicle in violation of
this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A conviction of a violation of
a law of a substantially similar nature in another jurisdiction, regardless of
whether that jurisdiction is a signatory to the Interstate Driver License
Compact pursuant to P.L.1966, c.73 (C.39:5D-1 et seq.), shall constitute a
prior conviction under this subsection unless the defendant can demonstrate by
clear and convincing evidence that the conviction in the other jurisdiction was
based exclusively upon a violation of a proscribed blood alcohol concentration
of less than 0.08%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the driving privilege of
any person is under revocation or suspension for a violation of any provision
of this Title or Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes at the time of any
conviction for a violation of this section, the revocation or suspension period
imposed shall commence as of the date of termination of the existing revocation
or suspension period.&nbsp; In the case of any person who at the time of the
imposition of sentence is less than 17 years of age, the forfeiture, suspension
or revocation of the driving privilege imposed by the court under this section
shall commence immediately, run through the offender's seventeenth birthday and
continue from that date for the period set by the court pursuant to paragraphs
(1) through (3) of this subsection.&nbsp; A court that imposes a term of
imprisonment for a first or second offense under this section may sentence the
person so convicted to the county jail, to the workhouse of the county wherein
the offense was committed, to an inpatient rehabilitation program or to an
Intoxicated Driver Resource Center or other facility approved by the chief of
the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit in the Department of Health.&nbsp; For a third
or subsequent offense a person shall not serve a term of imprisonment at an
Intoxicated Driver Resource Center as provided in subsection (f).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who has been
convicted of a previous violation of this section need not be charged as a
second or subsequent offender in the complaint made against him in order to
render him liable to the punishment imposed by this section on a second or
subsequent offender, but if the second offense occurs more than 10 years after
the first offense, the court shall treat the second conviction as a first
offense for sentencing purposes and if a third offense occurs more than 10
years after the second offense, the court shall treat the third conviction as a
second offense for sentencing purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; A person convicted under
this section must satisfy the screening, evaluation, referral, program and fee
requirements of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services'
Intoxicated Driving Program Unit, and of the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers
and a program of alcohol and drug education and highway safety, as prescribed
by the chief administrator.&nbsp; The sentencing court shall inform the person
convicted that failure to satisfy such requirements shall result in a mandatory
two-day term of imprisonment in a county jail and a driver license revocation
or suspension and continuation of revocation or suspension until such
requirements are satisfied, unless stayed by court order in accordance with the
Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, or R.S.39:5-22.&nbsp; Upon
sentencing, the court shall forward to the Division of Mental Health and
Addiction Services' Intoxicated Driving Program Unit a copy of a person's
conviction record.&nbsp; A fee of $100 shall be payable to the Alcohol Education, Rehabilitation
and Enforcement Fund established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1983, c.531
(C.26:2B-32) to support the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon conviction of a
violation of this section, the court shall collect forthwith the New Jersey
driver's license or licenses of the person so convicted and forward such
license or licenses to the chief administrator.&nbsp; The court shall inform the
person convicted that if he is convicted of personally operating a motor
vehicle during the period of license suspension imposed pursuant to subsection
(a) of this section, he shall, upon conviction, be subject to the penalties
established in R.S.39:3-40. The person convicted shall be informed orally and
in writing.&nbsp; A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of that written
notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to
acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense
to a subsequent charge of a violation of R.S.39:3-40.&nbsp; In the event that a
person convicted under this section is the holder of any out-of-State driver's
license, the court shall not collect the license but shall notify forthwith the
chief administrator, who shall, in turn, notify appropriate officials in the
licensing jurisdiction.&nbsp; The court shall, however, revoke the nonresident's
driving privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State, in accordance with
this section.&nbsp; Upon conviction of a violation of this section, the court shall
notify the person convicted, orally and in writing, of the penalties for a
second, third or subsequent violation of this section.&nbsp; A person shall be
required to acknowledge receipt of that written notice in writing. Failure to
receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a
written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of
this section.</p>

shall promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) in order to establish
a program of alcohol education and highway safety, as prescribed by this act.</p>

violation of this section who is liable to punishment imposed by this section
as a second or subsequent offender shall be entitled to the same rights of
discovery as allowed defendants pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of
the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp; The counties, in
cooperation with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the
commission, but subject to the approval of the Division of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, shall designate and establish on a county or regional basis
Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers.&nbsp; These centers shall have the capability
of serving as community treatment referral centers and as court monitors of a
person's compliance with the ordered treatment, service alternative or
community service.&nbsp; All centers established pursuant to this subsection shall
be administered by a counselor certified by the Alcohol and Drug Counselor
Certification Board of New Jersey or other professional with a minimum of five
years' experience in the treatment of alcoholism.&nbsp; All centers shall be
required to develop individualized treatment plans for all persons attending
the centers; provided that the duration of any ordered treatment or referral
shall not exceed one year.&nbsp; It shall be the center's responsibility to
establish networks with the community alcohol and drug education, treatment and
rehabilitation resources and to receive monthly reports from the referral agencies
regarding a person's participation and compliance with the program.&nbsp; Nothing in
this subsection shall bar these centers from developing their own education and
treatment programs; provided that they are approved by the Division of Mental
Health and Addiction Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a person's failure to
report to the initial screening or any subsequent ordered referral, the
Intoxicated Driver Resource Center shall promptly notify the sentencing court
of the person's failure to comply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required detention periods at
the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers shall be determined according to the
individual treatment classification assigned by the Intoxicated Driving Program
Unit. Upon attendance at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center, a person shall
be required to pay a per diem fee of $75 for the first offender program or a
per diem fee of $100 for the second offender program, as appropriate.&nbsp; Any
increases in the per diem fees after the first full year shall be determined
pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Health in
consultation with the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse pursuant
to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.).</p>

program of alcohol and drug education and highway safety, as prescribed by the
chief administrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; driving through a school
crossing as defined in R.S.39:1-1 knowing that juveniles are present if the municipality

convicted person shall: for a first offense, be fined not less than $500 or
more than $800, be imprisoned for not more than 60 days and have his license to
operate a motor vehicle suspended for a period of not less than one year or
more than two years; for a second offense, be fined not less than $1,000 or
more than $2,000, perform community service for a period of 60 days, be

under the circumstances and have his license to operate a motor vehicle
suspended for a period of four years; and, for a third offense, be fined
$2,000, imprisoned for 180 days in a county jail or workhouse, except that the
court may lower such term for each day, not exceeding 90 days, served
participating in a drug or alcohol inpatient rehabilitation program approved by
the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center, and have his license to operate a motor
vehicle suspended for a period of 20 years; the period of license suspension

any property used for school purposes which is owned by or leased to any
elementary or secondary school or school board produced pursuant to section 1
of P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7) may be used in a prosecution under paragraph (1)

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall not be relevant to
the imposition of sentence pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection
that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on
or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school
crossing.&nbsp; Nor shall it be relevant to the imposition of sentence that no
juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of
the offense or that the school was not in session.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h)&nbsp;&nbsp; A court also may order a
person convicted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, to participate in
a supervised visitation program as either a condition of probation or a form of
community service, giving preference to those who were under the age of 21 at
the time of the offense.&nbsp; Prior to ordering a person to participate in such a
program, the court may consult with any person who may provide useful
information on the defendant's physical, emotional and mental suitability for
the visit to ensure that it will not cause any injury to the defendant.&nbsp; The
court also may order that the defendant participate in a counseling session
under the supervision of the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit prior to
participating in the supervised visitation program.&nbsp; The supervised visitation
program shall be at one or more of the following facilities which have agreed
to participate in the program under the supervision of the facility's personnel
and the probation department:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; a trauma center,
critical care center or acute care hospital having basic emergency services,

appropriate victims of drunk drivers and victims who are, themselves, drunk
drivers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; a facility which cares
for advanced alcoholics or drug abusers, to observe persons in the advanced
stages of alcoholism or drug abuse; or</p>

medical examiner, the office of the county medical examiner or a public morgue
to observe appropriate victims of vehicle accidents involving drunk drivers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As used in this section,
&quot;appropriate victim&quot; means a victim whose condition is determined by
the facility's supervisory personnel and the probation officer to be
appropriate for demonstrating the results of accidents involving drunk drivers
without being unnecessarily gruesome or traumatic to the defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If at any time before or
during a visitation the facility's supervisory personnel and the probation
officer determine that the visitation may be or is traumatic or otherwise
inappropriate for that defendant, the visitation shall be terminated without
prejudice to the defendant.&nbsp; The program may include a personal conference
after the visitation, which may include the sentencing judge or the judge who
coordinates the program for the court, the defendant, defendant's counsel, and,
if available, the defendant's parents to discuss the visitation and its effect
on the defendant's future conduct.&nbsp; If a personal conference is not practicable
because of the defendant's absence from the jurisdiction, conflicting time
schedules, or any other reason, the court shall require the defendant to submit
a written report concerning the visitation experience and its impact on the
defendant.&nbsp; The county, a court, any facility visited pursuant to the program,
any agents, employees, or independent contractors of the court, county, or
facility visited pursuant to the program, and any person supervising a
defendant during the visitation, are not liable for any civil damages resulting
from injury to the defendant, or for civil damages associated with the
visitation which are caused by the defendant, except for willful or grossly
negligent acts intended to, or reasonably expected to result in, that injury or
damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill requires law
enforcement to obtain a blood sample from any person who is arrested for a
driving while intoxicated (DWI) offense and suspected of operating a motor
vehicle while under the influence of a narcotic, hallucinogenic, or
habit-producing drug.&nbsp; The blood sample would be used to conduct chemical tests
to determine the presence of any drug in the person's blood.&nbsp; The bill also
extends the State's implied consent statute to include blood testing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under current law, law
enforcement officers are not required to obtain a blood sample from persons who
are suspected of operating a vehicle while under the influence of an impairing
drug.&nbsp; At present, the chemical testing of persons suspected of drug-impaired
driving remains in the discretion of the arresting law enforcement agency.&nbsp;
Depending on the policy of the law enforcement agency, a blood or urine test
may be conducted to determine whether a suspect recently consumed an impairing
drug. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill provides that law
enforcement officers are required to obtain a blood sample from any person who
is arrested for a DWI offense and suspected of operating a vehicle while under
the influence of a narcotic, hallucinogenic, or habit-producing drug.&nbsp; The bill
also requires the blood sample to be taken with the person's consent or
authorized by a valid search warrant, and obtained in a medically acceptable
manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Jersey's current implied
consent statute provides that a person who operates a vehicle on a public road
or highway is deemed to have given consent to provide a breath test to
determine his or her blood alcohol concentration.&nbsp; A person who refuses to
provide a chemical breath test is subject to penalties for that refusal similar
to those imposed on persons convicted of DWI (fine, license suspension, and
ignition interlock requirements). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this bill, a person who
operates a vehicle on any of the State's roads or highways is also deemed to
have given consent to blood testing to determine whether that person had
consumed an impairing drug prior to operating the vehicle. A person who refuses
to provide a blood sample would be subject to penalties for that refusal.&nbsp; In
the event that a person suspected of impaired driving refuses to consent to
blood testing, the bill also authorizes a law enforcement officer to obtain a
blood sample from that person so long as the blood sample is authorized by a
search warrant and obtained in a medically acceptable manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
